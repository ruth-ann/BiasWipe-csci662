138074.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm not sure if it's properly called ``fifth tuning`` or ``perfect fifth tuning`` or what, but it does exist. The octave is slightly sharper than twice the frequency, but according to the book it sounds better that way because the first overtone of a piano is itself sharp. I don't have a piano, so I've never tried it; besides, the second overtone is even sharper than the first (stiff strings do that). -`	2002	True	article	random	test	FALSE

258303.0	`Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ``the history of science`` would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.

372885.0	`NEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks, but I don't have that link. I'm using the layout with a blue bar across the top (talk and uneditable pages are yellow, links are color coded and so on). I'll try logging out and seeing if it appears. Also, on naming conventions, did I make a mistake? To my knowledge the ``programming language`` suffix for languages has been a long-agreed-apon standard. I was just moving some pages to adhere to that. Sorry about not using the ``move this page`` feature though. I'll look again and see if it is there and I just didn't see it. For the record though, most of the articles I moved didn't have a history (I think maybe 2 or 3 of them did, but the others were only auto-imported or ``convertion script`` items without a history beyond that. Again, sorry if I messed things up. I'd be happy to fix anything I break if I can figure out how. Also, I should probably add redirects in those blank articles.  22:05 Oct 20, 2002 (UTC)`	2002	True	user	random	test	FALSE

587384.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDavid, I have a couple of questions regarding your last edit to Skene's glands. Basically, the article matched the given references better before your edit. Did you work off of some other reference?  03:35 Jan 11, 2003 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFeel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy the way, your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 23:32 Jan 14, 2003 (UTC)	2003	True	user	random	test	FALSE
