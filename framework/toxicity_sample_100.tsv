NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Deletion of Robert A Foster==NEWLINE_TOKENHello you have deleted a page for Robert A Foster. Please could you put it back on or can I make a new one? He is in the New BBC 'Just William' and is a up and coming actor.Many Thanks 9:00,29 Nov 2010 (GMT)NEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi. The entire contents of the page you (I assume) created and I deleted was {{hang on}}. The prior contents of the page, deleted by a different administrator, was [[Just William (2010 TV serial)]]. So the page was basically a blank slate with no tailored text at all upon both creations. If this actor is notable (see also Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Entertainers) then I suggest you create the page as a subpage of your user or user talk page so that you have time to work on it before ``going live`` by placing it in the main part of the encyclopedia, and so it doesn't get deleted again as having no substantive content. There is an article wizard which can walk you through the steps. You say he is an ``up and coming actor``. Well I don't know if there are sufficient sources to support an encyclopedia article, but this statement makes me wary. Please see Wikipedia:Up and coming next big thing. Note that if the page is an appropriate topic for an article, it would take normal English name punctuation, which means the middle initial would take a period, i.e., Robert A. Foster.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Deletion of International Association of Physics Students==NEWLINE_TOKENHello! You deleted the article for the International Association of Physics Students based on copyright infringement from the webpage iaps.info. It did seem that way, as the article was mostly copied from iaps.info, but it was done by the Executive Committee of IAPS, so we would like to ask you to reinstate the article. If it is needed we can put a statement on the homepage allowing wikipedia to copy written content from our page or something like that.

I have taken the liberty of adding a section header to your post and adding your signature; on talk pages (but not in articles), you should sign your posts so that people can follow who wrote what.Regarding the above page, there's a few matters you should understand. We cannot use copyrighted text simply because we have been given permission. Instead all of our text must be freely licensed so that our end users can take the material and use it themselves under our licenses. Please see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials. The upshot is that for us to use the material—which means allowing our readers to use it and modify it even for commercial purposes—we have to have a verified release of the material. To do that, you can follow either of the methods listed at the page. Specifically, please look at the subsection of the page entitled Granting us permission to copy material already online.If you do that, it will take care of a first hurdle but I don't think you should bother because the text itself is not appropriate for an article it its current form. This is an encyclopedia. Can you imagine a proper encyclopedia articles saying things like ``We support our members...``? What you should do is start from scratch and try to write a proper encyclopedia article that cites to reliable third party sources and contains neutral language. ([[User tal	2012	True	user	random	dev

65923689.0	 Itsmejudith, if you know any modern source I can look up to find the similar statements, please let me know. I'll get the book from library and replace the quote myself. I don't want to 'sneak' something into the article, I swear by God. Jewish Encyclopedia does have POV. Making connection between 'how one group of people treat the others' and 'their ancestors' are made in Bible (not by me). It might seem strange, but that's how Bible views things (forgive me if I'm wrong). Now, I found it interesting to include this POV into the article (i.e. this connection between Muslims and Jews). Mainmoinds refers to Muslims as Ishmaelies (if I am correct). Itsmejudith, I've been subject to a harsh block for reasons which I still don't know. I was accused of all kinds of imaginable crimes in wikipedia, ranging from nationalism bigotry related crimes to harrassment, disruption and personal attacks + several kinds of humuliations and getting ignored from the blocking admin on the top of it.

That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to , , , , , the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms.

402863248.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Perspective? ==NEWLINE_TOKEN``In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond person much?   `	2010	False	article	blocked	train
