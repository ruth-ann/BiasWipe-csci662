2232.0	This:NEWLINE_TOKEN:One can make an analogy in mathematical terms by envisioning the distribution of opinions in a population as a Gaussian curve. We would then say that the consensus would be a statement that represents the range of opinions within perhaps three standard deviations of the mean opinion.

26547.0	`This is such a fun entry.   DevotchkaNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -)NEWLINE_TOKEN:Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJKNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - JuuitchanNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``. LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI deleted the following pair: ``limited (Ltd)`` and ``incorporated``, since they actually mean different things. ``Incorporated`` means a corporation; ``limited`` means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJKNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, I'd call it a ``torch``, and it would probably be labeled as a ``flashlight`` in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The AnomeNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, so ``flashlight`` is correct British usage?

91460.0	`The actual idea behind time-out is to get the parent to cool-off. They are the real problem in a confrontation. It's rare that children need to ``cool off``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe theory behind adult time-outs is that you deprive the child of your attention. Of course, in our electronic gadget society where children hardly ever see their parents anyways, that accomplishes nothing. So as a replacement for spending time with one's child and paying attention to them most of the time, someone invented the ``child time-out`` as a form of punishment instead. This is not an acceptable trade-off and that's why child time-outs are bad. They're still better than physical abuse of course.  Ark`	2002	True	article	random	train	FALSE

139768.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Announcement===NEWLINE_TOKENI have compared Helga's original version and Helga's condensed version to each other as promised.  To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin ReformNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...NEWLINE_TOKENIn what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. NEWLINE_TOKENCopernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  NEWLINE_TOKEN*Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)NEWLINE_TOKEN*How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?NEWLINE_TOKEN*'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.
