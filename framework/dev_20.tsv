35367.0	`:In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. TawNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== From Interpreted Language/Talk ===NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtimeNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCould you elaborate ? TawNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEvery time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? TawNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  WesleyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Old Interpreted Language article ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, becauseNEWLINE_TOKENmost languages can be implemented in either way, and some languagesNEWLINE_TOKEN(like Perl) are compiled atNEWLINE_TOKENruntime but behave as if they were interpreted.NEWLINE_TOKENOther languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into anNEWLINE_TOKENintermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).NEWLINE_TOKENSome languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs Java interpreted, or what? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java programming language article says:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldtNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWay too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of ``compiling``.NEWLINE_TOKENIt is used in two distinct meanings, as in:NEWLINE_TOKEN# compiled to machine code (or assembly)NEWLINE_TOKEN# compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representationNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way ``compiled``. In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all ``compile`` source to some form of internal representation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENQuote from FOLDOC:NEWLINE_TOKEN     CompilerNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN     A program that converts another programNEWLINE_TOKEN     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) toNEWLINE_TOKEN     {machine language} (object code).

37675.0	`-NEWLINE_TOKENThis is not ``creative``.  Those are the dictionary definitions of the terms ``insurance`` and ``ensurance`` as properly applied to ``destruction``.  If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing ``personal`` or ``creative`` about it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving ``Mutual Assured Destruction`` to ``talk`` for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the ``ly``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGuess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.

207582.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)	2002	True	article	random	dev	FALSE

I know that you may feel that traditional forms of language don't properly express the sense of New Age, but the trick is to start from a common foundation, then build towards the vision, not start from the vision.

313929.0	NEWLINE_TOKEN:(1) I really do not want to cause anyone more work than necessary. But I can't help if someone try to suit every single article to his own fashion. You just throw out everything that does not fit to your personal view. Try to edit articles more for the reader and not for yourself. What is wrong if one sentence is not quite adequate and explicit. On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please. If you would have a chance, you would probably change even Gauss' work. Remember on what he had written about the estimation of the number of primes and such.NEWLINE_TOKEN:(2) I'll try to fix the table, that bothers you so much.

Sometimes you like and sometimes you don't. For instance it is more clear if we write, once we have agreed what | means, 3 | 9, than 3 divides 9. You have once said that any symbol in fact does not have much sence in math so here we go...NEWLINE_TOKEN:(5) What is wrong with Möbius function here or elsewhere. When I make a table, it is clear after that what values are, but try to 'calculate' its values from your mind. I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what μ(n) means and shows. Simply as that.NEWLINE_TOKEN:(6) I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project. You correct me and I correct you if and only if I can. I am pretty tired of writting articles which envolve math, but I like math very much. And because you know something from the math, you can give your knowledge to others and not just fixing things all around as it is going for one math test. My teachers are mathematicians themselves. Only you change these articles so much, no one else. So I can't figure that they do not understand what is written in them. Egziabeher.  17:20 Sep 25, 2002 (UTC)	2002	True	article	random	dev	FALSE
